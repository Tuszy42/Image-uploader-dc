# Technologies used
In this challange I wanted to try out my vanilla knowledge, using no libraries, except for the firebase one, which is needed to upload the image.
Although the challange does not need me to follow the initial design, I wanted to concentrate on the technical side, not redesign the interface, and as such, practice building a website according to a figma design.
The markup and the script part are plain and simple, for the styles I was trying to follow BEM principles.
